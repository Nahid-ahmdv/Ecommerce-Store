Remember, in the session data, we're recording and storing the ID of each product that is in the database. In our session data, we're storing only the ID of each product (not its other attributes).
      What we need to do is take the session data, look at all the IDs of the products we've stored, and extract from the 'Product' database all the product instances corresponding to those IDs. We made a copy of the original basket, and to that copy, we've added a reference by a key named 'product' to the product instance that has an ID equal to what we have stored in our original basket.-->
