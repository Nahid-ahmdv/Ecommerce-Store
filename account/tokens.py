#Django provides us a way to generate password reset tokens through the 'PasswordResetTokenGenerator' class. 
# Now we can also use this class to create account activation tokens. Here we want to create a unique token for that particular user that’s just signed up, 
# we’re sending that token to them via email, the user will click on the link which will have the token as part of the link and then we’ll be able to extract that token back once they’ve clicked on that link and come back to our site 
# and then we can use that token to check to see if that user is valid (by calling 'check_token(user, token)') and then we can go ahead and activate their account if they are a valid use.
#the token is gonna be de-encrypt and the user.pk part of it is gonna extract from it and check in the database if that user exist and then go ahead and activate them.


#defineing a custom token generator for account activation in Django by subclassing the built-in 'PasswordResetTokenGenerator' class.
from django.contrib.auth.tokens import PasswordResetTokenGenerator #This is a Django class that generates tokens for password resets (also account activations). It uses user information and a timestamp to create a unique token.
from six import text_type #using 'text_type' helps ensure that all parts of the token generation process are treated as Unicode strings.

#Custom Token Generator Class:
class AccountActivationTokenGenerator(PasswordResetTokenGenerator): #This class inherits from 'PasswordResetTokenGenerator' class. By subclassing, you can customize the behavior of the token generation process.
    
    #Overriding '_make_hash_value' which is a method (generator) for generating tokens from a number of different parameters (creating hash values):
    def _make_hash_value(self, user, timestamp): #This method is overridden to define how the hash value for the token is generated. The hash value is crucial because it determines whether a token is valid or has expired.
        return (
            text_type(user.pk) + text_type(timestamp) +
            text_type(user.is_active)
        )
    '''
    Parameters:
        user: This parameter represents the user object for whom the token is being generated.
        timestamp: This is the time at which the token was created.
    Hash Value Composition:
        The method constructs a string that combines:
        The primary key (pk) of the user (a unique identifier).
        The timestamp when the token was created.
        The user's is_active status (a boolean indicating whether the user's account is active).
        By concatenating these values, you create a unique hash that changes if any of these attributes change. For example, if the user’s primary key or active status changes, or if a different timestamp is used, the resulting hash will be different.

'''
Summary
In summary, this code defines a custom token generator for account activation in Django by extending 'PasswordResetTokenGenerator' class. 
It overrides 'the _make_hash_value' method to create a unique hash based on the user's primary key, the current timestamp, and their active status. 
This ensures that each generated token is unique and tied specifically to that user at that point in time. You can use this token generator to send activation links via email to users upon registration, 
allowing them to activate their accounts securely.

'''
Django provides a way to generate password reset tokens through the 'PasswordResetTokenGenerator' class. This class can also be utilized to create unique account activation tokens for users who have just signed up.
Token Generation:
The 'PasswordResetTokenGenerator' generates a hash value based on user-related data, which includes the user's password salt and last login timestamp. This ensures that the token is unique to that user and changes if any of these properties are modified (e.g., when the user changes their password).
Creating Activation Tokens:
To create an activation token for a newly registered (signed up) user, you can use the same mechanism as the password reset token. The generated token is sent to the user's email as part of an activation link.
Activation Link:
When the user clicks on the link containing the token, they are directed back to your site. The link usually includes the token and a user identifier (like a base64 encoded user ID) to identify which account to activate.
Validating Tokens:
Once the user clicks the link, you can extract the token from the URL and use it to verify if it is valid by calling check_token(user, token). If valid, you can proceed to activate their account.
Security Features:
The tokens generated are designed to expire after a certain period (default is 7 days, configurable via 'PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT_DAYS' in your settings). This means that if a user does not activate their account within this timeframe, they will need to request a new activation link.
No Database Storage:
Importantly, Django's implementation does not store these tokens in the database; instead, they are generated dynamically based on user properties. This method enhances security by ensuring that even if a token is intercepted, it cannot be reused after its intended purpose (like resetting a password or activating an account).
Summary
In summary, your description accurately captures the essence of using Django's password reset token generator for account activation purposes. It highlights how tokens are created uniquely for each user, sent via email, validated upon clicking the link, and how they enhance security by being time-limited and not stored in the database.
