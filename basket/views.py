'''
The 'Basket' class (within 'basket.py') handles session management for storing items in a user's cart, 
while the 'basket_add' function processes requests to add items to that cart and returns feedback about how many items are currently in it.

in 'Basket' class The instance variables 'self.basket' and 'self.session' are set based on the session data.
This means that every instance of 'Basket' class will have its own session and basket, which are initialized based on the current user's request.
'''

Structure of the basket:

basket = {
'product_id_1': {'price': '10.00', 'qty': 2},
'product_id_2': {'price': '15.50', 'qty': 1},
...
}

example:
basket = {
'1': {'price': '10.00', 'qty': 2},
'2': {'price': '15.50', 'qty': 1}
}
the basket.__len__() method would return the number of unique products currently stored in the basket, not the total quantity of all items. in the above example, there are two unique product IDs in the basket: '1' and '2'.
Therefore, calling basket.__len__() would return 2.
If you wanted to get the total quantity of all items in the basket (which is often what users think of when considering the "length" of a basket), you would need to sum the quantities of each product. Hereâ€™s how you could do that:
python
total_quantity = sum(item['qty'] for item in self.basket.values())

In your example:
For Product ID '1', the quantity is 3.
For Product ID '2', the quantity is 1.
So, the total quantity would be:
Total Quantity = 3 (from product ID 1) + 1 (from product ID 2) = 4
